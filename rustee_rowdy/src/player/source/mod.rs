/// A source of samples.
///
/// # A quick lesson about sounds
///
/// ## Sampling
///
/// A sound is a vibration that propagates through air and reaches your ears. This vibration can
/// be represented as an analog signal.
///
/// In order to store this signal in the computer's memory or on the disk, we perform what is
/// called *sampling*. The consists in choosing an interval of time (for example 20µs) and reading
/// the amplitude of the signal at each interval (for example, if the interval is 20µs we read the
/// amplitude every 20µs). By doing so we obtain a list of numerical values, each value being
/// called a *sample*.
///
/// Therefore a sound can be represented in memory by a frequency and a list of samples. The
/// frequency is expressed in hertz and corresponds to the number of samples that have been
/// read per second. For example if we read one sample every 20µs, the frequency would be
/// 50000 Hz. In reality, common values for the frequency are 44100, 48000 and 96000.
///
/// ## Channels
///
/// But a frequency and a list of values only represent one signal. When you listen to a sound,
/// your left and right ears don't receive exactly the same signal. In order to handle this,
/// we usually record not one but two different signals: one for the left ear and one for the right
/// ear. We say that such a sound has two *channels*.
///
/// Sometimes sounds even have five or six channels, each corresponding to a location around the
/// head of the listener.
///
/// The standard in audio manipulation is to *interleave* the multiple channels. In other words,
/// in a sound with two channels the list of samples contains the first sample of the first
/// channel, then the first sample of the second channel, then the second sample of the first
/// channel, then the second sample of the second channel, and so on. The same applies if you have
/// more than two channels. The rodio library only supports this schema.
///
/// Therefore in order to represent a sound in memory in fact we need three characteristics: the
/// frequency, the number of channels, and the list of samples.
///
/// ## The `Source` trait
///
/// A Rust object that represents a sound should implement the `Source` trait.
///
/// The three characteristics that describe a sound are provided through this trait:
///
/// - The number of channels can be retrieved with `channels`.
/// - The frequency can be retrieved with `sample_rate`.
/// - The list of values can be retrieved by iterating on the source. The `Source` trait requires
///   that the `Iterator` trait be implemented as well.
///
/// # Frames
///
/// The samples rate and number of channels of some sound sources can change by itself from time
/// to time.
///
/// > **Note**: As a basic example, if you play two audio files one after the other and treat the
/// > whole as a single source, then the channels and samples rate of that source may change at the
/// > transition between the two files.
///
/// However, for optimization purposes rodio supposes that the number of channels and the frequency
/// stay the same for long periods of time and avoids calling `channels()` and
/// `sample_rate` too frequently.
///
/// In order to properly handle this situation, the `current_frame_len()` method should return
/// the number of samples that remain in the iterator before the samples rate and number of
/// channels can potentially change.
///
