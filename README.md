This repository serves as a template for Flutter projects calling into native Rust
libraries via `flutter_rust_bridge`.

## Getting Started

To begin, ensure that you have a working installation of the following items:
- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- [Rust language](https://rustup.rs/)
- Appropriate [Rust targets](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/cross-compilation.html) for cross-compiling to your device
- For Android targets:
    - Install [cargo-ndk](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk#installing)
    - Install Android NDK 22, then put its path in one of the `gradle.properties`, e.g.:

```
echo "ANDROID_NDK=.." >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
```

- Web is not supported yet.

Then go ahead and run `flutter run`! When you're ready, refer to our documentation
[here](https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_rust_bridge/index.html)
to learn how to write and use binding code.

Extra Config:

Arch Linux:

- Add following in `~/.zshrc`
  ```shell
    export CPATH="$(clang -v 2>&1 | grep "Selected GCC installation" | rev | cut -d' ' -f1 | rev)/include"
  ```
